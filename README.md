## Basic CRUD App - React/Redux

I'm learning the basics of Redux doing the hard way, coding.

### Things I've learned with this project:

#### What is Redux?
 - State management library that gives me access to state anywhere in my components without the need to pass props. 
#### Store
 - It's where the entire state of application will live.
 - Is an object which has some methods in it that allow me to get the current state of application.
 - I don't have to pass down data from the parent component.
